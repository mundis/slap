What is a Smart Label Printer ® ?

Seiko Instruments manufacture a range of printers designed especially for
printing stick-on labels. These printers are vastly superior to
general-purpose printers (laser, inkjet or dotmatrix) for producing labels:
   * no toner or ink needed
   * print labels one-at-a-time or
     hundreds-at-a-time with no waste!
   * very quiet and very small: suitable for
     desktop use
   * use very little power
   * very simple to load labels (no messing with   [picture of an SLP-220]
     tractors again)
   * no need to replace very expensive
     fusing-rollers or print-heads that have
     become "glued-up".
   * no danger of the labels being shredded by
     the printer!

What is slap?

slap is a UNIX program that prints labels on a Smart Label Printer. Typical
applications include:

   * address labels
   * labels for audio cassettes, CDs, videos
   * diskette labels
   * labels for file-folders, notebooks
   * ID badges
   * labels, labels, labels - use your imagination...

slap is a command-line program - a GUI version is planned for the future.
Currently it only prints plain text, but you can choose any of several
typefaces - it is distributed with a set of 16 bitmap fonts, each in 6
point-sizes.

slap can automatically detect which model of SmartLabel printer you are
using, and adapts accordingly.

Why do I need slap to use a Smart Label Printer?

The Smart Label Printers are bitmap printers - unlike most printers, they do
not themselves convert character data into a pattern of dots. That is a job
for software running on the host computer.

These printers also use special-purpose communication- and command-protocols
- which have to be handled by software running on the host computer.

Under UNIX, slap does both these jobs - see the manpage.
