slap is a UNIX print-driver program for all models of Seiko Instruments'
Smart Label Printer ®.

Seiko Instruments do not provide software or drivers for UNIX platforms. But
I do!

The current release of slap is 2.4.4, dated 9th February 2001.

Latest News - version 2.4.4

   * Added baud-rate mapping schemes to enable use of SLP-100, SLP-200 and
     SLP-240 printers on (some) platforms that do not provide 57600 baud
     facility in their native programming interfaces. Also fixed typos that
     prevented compilation on all such systems.
   * Fixed occasional comms crash for SLP-EZ30, SLP-Plus and SLP printers.
   * Fixed "missing last half-dot" for SLP-EZ30, SLP-Plus and SLP printers.
   * Fixed theoretical sequencing bug in the recovery-from-printer-error
     logic.
   * Added documents describing how to use additional fonts with slap, and
     how to print barcodes.

Coming Next!

   * Full modularisation into separate programs: low-level bitmap printer,
     text-rendering front-ends for various font types, GUI front-ends, and
     so on. This will also enable full PostScript capabilities, by using
     GhostScript as a preprocessor. Thanks to Andreas Kostyrka and Don Smith
     for ideas and inspiration.
