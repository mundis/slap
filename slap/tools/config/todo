The indentation reflects dependancies, eg: to get the settings needed
to build CDE programs, you would need to invoke x11.api, motif.api and
cde.api, in that order.


tli.api		# the SVR4 "transport-layer-interface"

pthread.api	# POSIX threads API, aka POSIX.1c (previously POSIX.4)

curses.api

x11.api		# only the -I and -L settings for the common "low-level" APIs
		# (Xlib, Xt, Athena widgets, Xmu, etc); the -l flags needed
		# will be presumed well-known (and common!). 
	motif.api
		cde.api
	xview.api	# including the OpenLook substrate

nis2.api	# aka Sun YP

nis3.api	# aka NIS+

sunrpc.api
