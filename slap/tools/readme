These program need to be able to run on a wide variety of UNIX, UNIX-derived
and UNIX-like systems, including some as old as UNIX v7 (c.1980).

Thus they are written in to use ONLY the most minimal, generic, available and
portable set of UNIX facilities.

Some facilities that should be avoided, in order to meet the above portability
objectives, include:

	basename
	cut
	paste
	join
	awk
	nawk (and gawk, mawk, etc)
	m4
	shell-functions
	nested shell command-substitutions
	getopts
	getopt
	extended regular-expressions (in any context)
	dirname
	dirs
	pushd
	popd
	true
	false
	install
	pax
	cpio
	echo with flags or metacharacters
	cat with flags
	the [ command with flags other than -r -w -x -f and -d
	diff3
	dircmp
	symbolic file-access permissions
	file-access permissions outside the range 0-0777
	non-Bourne-compatible shells or syntax
	xargs
	perl
	printf
	print
	select
	mkdir with flags
	cp with flags
	ln with flags
	rmdir with flags
	rm with flags other than -r and -f
