.TH lstol @LF 23jun97 "MJSulib"
.SH NAME
lstol \- convert 32-bit quantum from LSB-first into native byte-order
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "mjsu.h"

ULONG lstol(ULONG quantum);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlstol()\fP computes the value of \fIquantum\fP in native byte-order
on the assumption that the original byte-order was
"least-significant-byte-first".
.LP
This is useful for reading data-structures from those files
where 32-bit quanta
are recorded in LSB-first format.
.SH RETURNS
\fBlstol()\fP returns the converted value.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBltols(@LF)\fP,
\fBlstos(@LF)\fP,
\fBmjsu(@MI)\fP.
.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBlstol()\fP
is written in C,
conforming to ANSI X3.159-1989.
